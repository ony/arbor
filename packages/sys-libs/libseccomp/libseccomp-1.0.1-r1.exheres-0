SUMMARY="High level interface to the Linux Kernel's seccomp filter"
DESCRIPTION="
The libseccomp library provides and easy to use, platform independent, interface to the Linux
Kernel's syscall filtering mechanism: seccomp. The libseccomp API is designed to abstract away the
underlying BPF based syscall filter language and present a more conventional function-call based
filtering interface that should be familiar to, and easily adopted by application developers.
