SUMMARY="XZ Utils is free general-purpose data compression software with high compression ratio"
DESCRIPTION="
This is achieved by providing tools and libraries which are similar to use than
the equivalents of the most popular existing compression algorithms.

XZ Utils consist of several components:
* liblzma is a compression library with API similar to that of zlib.
* xz is a command line tool with syntax similar to that of gzip.
* xzdec is a decompression-only tool smaller than the full-featured xz tool.
* A set of shell scripts (xzgrep, xzdiff, etc.) have been adapted from gzip to ease viewing,
grepping, and comparing compressed files.
