SUMMARY="Full-featured and high performance event loop library"
DESCRIPTION="
Features include child/pid watchers, periodic timers based on wallclock
(absolute) time (in addition to timers using relative timeouts), as well as
epoll/kqueue/event ports/inotify (for file watchers) support, fast timer
management, time jump detection and correction, and ease-of-use.

It can be used as a libevent replacement using its emulation API or directly
embedded into your programs without the need for complex configuration support.
A full-featured and well-documented perl interface is also available.
